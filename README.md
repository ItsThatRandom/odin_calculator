# odin_calculator
Webpage based calculator built to meet the project guidelines from 'The Odin Project', outlined here https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator.

Realistically, should refactor at some point in the future as it feels very messy and poorly planned/designed. Doesn't include the ability to use decimals, entering of negative numbers or use of keyboard.

Lessons learned: 
    -   Plan better rather than jumping straight in. 
    -   Learned about the use of custom html properties, i.e. 'data-'.
    -   Gained a better understanding of CSS's Grid and try out different css properties.
